      title: 'Rice leaf folder',
      content: `Intensive fertilizer usage promotes the rapid proliferation
      of the insect. The presence of high humidity and shaded regions within the field,
      along with the existence of grassy weeds from both rice fields and surrounding
      borders, contributes to the pest’s growth. Increased rice cultivation with irrigation
      systems, multiple rice cropping, and insecticide use leading to resurgences play
      significant roles in the abundance of these insects. Rice leaf folders can be found
      in all rice environments but are more prevalent during rainy seasons. They tend
      to inhabit shady areas and regions where rice is heavily fertilized. In tropical rice
      regions, they remain active throughout the year, while in temperate countries, their
      activity spans from May to October. Examine the plant for the following indications:
      – Longitudinal and transparent whitish streaks on affected leaves.
      7
      – Tubular folded leaves.
      – Leaf tips are sometimes attached to the lower part of the leaf.
      – Fields heavily infested may show scorching with numerous folded leaves`

      title: 'Rice leaf blast',
      content: `Blast disease can manifest wherever there are blast spores.
      It commonly appears in regions characterized by low soil moisture, frequent and
      extended rain showers, and cool daytime temperatures. Initial lesions are recognizable by their white to gray-green
      appearance, accompanied by dark green borders. As they age, these lesions take on
      an elliptical or spindle-like shape with whitish-to-gray centers and red-to-brownish
      or necrotic borders. Another symptom of leaf blast resembles a diamond shape,
      wider in the center and tapering towards the ends. In severe cases, lesions can
      merge, leading to the destruction of entire leaves.`

      title: 'Brown spot',
      content: ` The disease tends to emerge in regions with elevated relative humidity (between 86% and 100%) and temperatures ranging from 16°C to
      36°C. It is frequently found in soil lacking proper nutrients or in soils that accu-
      mulate harmful substances. Infected seedlings display small, circular lesions in shades of
      yellow-brown or brown, potentially encircling the coleoptile and distorting primary
      and secondary leaves. As the crop reaches the tillering stage, lesions emerge on the
      leaves. Initially, these lesions are small, circular, and dark brown to purple-brown.
      Once fully developed, they take on a circular to oval shape with a light brown to
      gray center, encompassed by a reddish-brown margin formed by the fungi’s toxin.
      On susceptible varieties, lesions can be 5-14 mm long, leading to leaf wilting. On
      resistant varieties, the lesions appear brown and are the size of pinheads.`
